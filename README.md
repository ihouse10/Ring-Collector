# Ring-Collector python game

I made during my college years to learn Python. I use open source game engine called PyGame (http://www.pygame.org) to develop this game. I learned this by myself by following online tutorials, youtube videos, and the PyGame documentation. This was my first introduction to Python.

### How to run

Install PyGame with PIP

```
pip pygame
```

Run game with Python command

```
python Main.py
```
